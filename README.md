# TraCog Traffic Simulation

## Description
TraCog is a Python-based traffic simulation project developed using Pygame to model intersection vehicle movement. The project focuses on implementing real-time traffic signal adjustments to optimize traffic flow. Additionally, TraCog incorporates an algorithm simulating diverse vehicle types, lane changes, and turns. A real-time graphical user interface (GUI) has been designed to visualize traffic signals, timers, and vehicle counts.
